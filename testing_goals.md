Testing and Evaluation Strategy for a Clojure Chess Engine

1. Testing Move Generation and Legality (Perft)

Perft (performance test) is the gold standard for validating move generation. It counts all legal leaf nodes to a specific depth from a given position. For example:

Depth	Expected Node Count (Initial Position)
1	20
2	400
3	8,902
4	197,281

Steps:
•	Implement a Perft function.
•	Use known test positions (e.g., perftsuite.epd) and compare results.
•	Use a divide function to debug errors in subtree move generation.

Edge Case Unit Tests:
•	Castling legality.
•	En passant conditions.
•	Pawn promotions (all types).
•	King safety (removing moves that leave king in check).

2. Benchmarking with Chess Engine Test Suites

Once move legality is solid, test search and evaluation using known problem suites.

Popular Suites:

Suite	Description
WAC (Win at Chess)	300 tactical puzzles. Great for testing tactical vision.
Bratko-Kopec Test	24 strategic positions. Measures positional understanding.
LCT II	35 positions across tactics, strategy, endgames. Balanced benchmark.
STS (Strategic Test Suite)	Positions grouped by concept (e.g. outposts, files). Great for positional depth.
Arasan Test Suite	Modern positions, including traps. Good general benchmark.

How to Use:
•	Load positions from EPD/PGN.
•	Let engine analyze each position with a fixed depth or time.
•	Check if best move matches known correct one.
•	Track score over time for evaluation improvements.

3. Measuring Elo Strength Over Time

Requirements:
•	Implement UCI or XBoard protocol for engine interop.
•	Use automation tools to run many games.

Tools:
•	Cutechess-cli – Headless engine-vs-engine testing tool.
•	BayesElo – Estimates Elo ratings using match results.
•	Arena or Banksia GUI – For visual tournaments and Elo tracking.

Steps:
1.	Run self-play matches (e.g., new vs old version).
2.	Use 500–1000 games for statistical significance.
3.	Calculate Elo delta:
•	60% score ≈ +76 Elo
•	Use BayesElo for precision and confidence intervals.
4.	Track Elo across versions (e.g., v1.0 = 1500, v1.1 = +50 Elo).
5.	Optionally use SPRT (Sequential Probability Ratio Test) for quicker evaluation of small changes.

4. Integration and Tooling (Clojure-Specific Notes)

UCI Protocol in Clojure:
•	Use read-line + println for stdin/stdout.
•	Parse commands like uci, position, go.
•	Flush output after each command.

External Tools:
•	Use clojure.java.shell/sh or ProcessBuilder to call:
•	cutechess-cli
•	bayeselo
•	PGN/EPD parsing: use Java libs like PGN4Java via interop.

Testing Frameworks:
•	Use clojure.test to write:
•	Unit tests for rule enforcement.
•	Regression tests for Perft counts.
•	Eval tests using tactical suite matches.

Performance:
•	Accept slower development at first.
•	Consider Java interop for hotspots later if needed.
